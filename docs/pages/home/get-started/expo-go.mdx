The fastest way to get up and running is to use the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) client app on your Android or iOS device. It allows you to open up apps served through Expo CLI and run your projects faster when developing them.

## Install Expo Go on your device

It is available on both the Android Play Store and iOS App Store.

- [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) - Android Lollipop (5) and greater
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) - iOS 13 and greater

## Login into Expo Go

Open the Expo Go app after it has finished installing. If you have created an account with Expo CLI, you can sign in by clicking the **Login** button in the top header on the **Home** tab. Signing in will make it easier for you to open projects in the Expo Go app while developing them &mdash; they will appear automatically under the **Projects** section on the **Home** tab of the app.

> Sometimes, it can be useful to run your app directly on your computer instead of on a separate physical device. If you would like to set this up, you can learn more about [installing an Android Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator) and [installing the iOS Simulator (macOS only)](/workflow/ios-simulator).

## Next steps

Now that Expo Go app is installed, [let's create a new app and write some code](/get-started/create-a-new-app).
