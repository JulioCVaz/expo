In this guide, you'll learn what you need to install in your project to create a development build.

## Prerequisites

You need to initialize your project with Expo. If you still need to do so, see the [initializing steps](/get-started/create-a-new-app/#initializing-the-project) if you are starting a new project.

We also recommend installing EAS CLI as a global npm dependency by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g eas-cli']} />

## Install expo-dev-client

To initialize a development build, you need to install the `expo-dev-client` library in your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

## Next steps

That's it! You're ready to create a development build. For more information, see the [Create a build](/home/develop/development-builds/create-a-build) guide.
